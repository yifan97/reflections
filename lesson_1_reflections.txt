1. It could be useful when you want to know which lines you delete and if that deletion matches your expectation
2. Easy to check typo
3. You can refer back to any specific time when you changed the file
4. pros: more flexible to choose when to save and what version to save.
   cons: sometimes it could be nightmare when you forget to save a significant version change
5. allowing saving multiples like Git avoids dis-match with files which must match with each other 
6. use git log to view the whole history of commits and use git diff to compare two versions which will show you number of deletions and additions
7. I am no longer afraid of making any subtle changes since I can always refer back when something unexpected happens
8. Having my workspace setup, I want to try using Git for big project!
